      <h1><code>BlueHats</code>, who's inÂ ?</h1>
      <p>
	The <code>BlueHats</code> are all the people who want to show that they contribute to Free and Open Source software developed and/or used by public agencies <strong>across the world</strong>: public servants involved in the use and development of these software, of course, but also citizens who recognize that their actions for Free Software help the administration's projects.
      </p>
      <p>
	<code>BlueHats</code> is <em>not</em> a product or brand of the French Free Software unit.  It's a global movement to which our unit contributes by publishing a <a href="/fr/bluehats/tags/gazette/">newsletter in French</a>, organizing <a href="/fr/bluehats/tags/atelier/">online workshops</a>, and <a href="/fr/bluehats/tags/rencontre/">in-person meetings</a>.  All public agencies across the world are invited to contribute to this movement!
